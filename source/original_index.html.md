# Introduction

Welcome to the Translation Proxy API consumer specification! You can use the information presented here to build an API compatible to the Translation Proxy consumer needs.

The Translation Proxy system allows WPML and Translation Service to communicate efficiently. Send jobs for translation and receive them. There is no direct communication between WPML and Translation Services.

WPML has a common interface, that allows website admins to activate and authenticate with the Translation Service, select translatable content and send it to Translation Proxy. As soon as Translation Proxy delivers the data to Translation Service, website admins are expected to login to the Translation Service admin panel and complete the configuration (select translators, accept bids, etc.). When a translation is ready, Translation Service will send a notification to Translation Proxy to download the completed translation and deliver it to WPML.

# Communication workflow

Here is an example of standard communication workflow between Translation Proxy and Translation Service.
 
To be able to send any data to Translation Service user is required to have an account in the Translation Service (WPML does not allow to create an account in Translation Services).
We are also assuming that user, as soon as Translation Proxy delivers all files for translation, from WPML to the Translation Service, must complete the configuration in the Translation Service admin panel. WPML does not provide any option to choose (e.g. translators or any special translation options). All those options has to be set from the Translation Service admin panel.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
